  <h1 align="center">ScreenMenu Primer</h1>
  <a align="center">A companion plugin for [CS2MenuManager](https://github.com/schwarper/CS2MenuManager) by [schwarper](https://github.com/schwarper) that creates & then removes a dummy ScreenMenu whenever a player joins a map for the first time. This generates the worldtext entity that will be used in later ScreenMenu creation. For lower tier hardware, this alleviates the issue where frame time will birefly tank when a player has a ScreenMenu created for the first time. Since the resource heavy entity creation is handled before they start playing, they won't experience any lag while playing.</a><br><br>
